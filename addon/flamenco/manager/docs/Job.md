# Job


## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **str** |  | 
**type** | **str** |  | 
**submitter_platform** | **str** | Operating system of the submitter. This is used to recognise two-way variables. This should be a lower-case version of the platform, like \&quot;linux\&quot;, \&quot;windows\&quot;, \&quot;darwin\&quot;, \&quot;openbsd\&quot;, etc. Should be ompatible with Go&#39;s &#x60;runtime.GOOS&#x60;; run &#x60;go tool dist list&#x60; to get a list of possible platforms. As a special case, the platform \&quot;manager\&quot; can be given, which will be interpreted as \&quot;the Manager&#39;s platform\&quot;. This is mostly to make test/debug scripts easier, as they can use a static document on all platforms.  | 
**id** | **str** | UUID of the Job | 
**created** | **datetime** | Creation timestamp | 
**updated** | **datetime** | Timestamp of last update. | 
**status** | [**JobStatus**](JobStatus.md) |  | 
**activity** | **str** | Description of the last activity on this job. | 
**priority** | **int** |  | defaults to 50
**type_etag** | **str** | Hash of the job type, copied from the &#x60;AvailableJobType.etag&#x60; property of the job type. The job will be rejected if this field doesn&#39;t match the actual job type on the Manager. This prevents job submission with old settings, after the job compiler script has been updated. If this field is ommitted, the check is bypassed.  | [optional] 
**settings** | [**JobSettings**](JobSettings.md) |  | [optional] 
**metadata** | [**JobMetadata**](JobMetadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]

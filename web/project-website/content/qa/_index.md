### â€‹What's the difference with OpenCue?

OpenCue is aimed at a different audience than Flamenco. OpenCue is a huge and
complex project, and relies on a lot of components
([source](https://www.opencue.io/docs/getting-started/)), whereas Flamenco is
made for simplicity and use in small studios or at home, running on your own
hardware.

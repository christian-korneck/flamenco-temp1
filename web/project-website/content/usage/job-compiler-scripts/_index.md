## Task Types

The following task types are defined by the standard job compiler scripts:

- `blender`: any task that runs Blender.
- `ffmpeg`: any task that runs FFmpeg.
- `file-management`: moving or copying files, creating directories, moving old
  renders out of the way to make place for new ones, etc.
- `misc`: tasks mostly used for testing things, such as "log a debug message" or
  "do nothing for 5 seconds".
